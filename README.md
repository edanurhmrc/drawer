# drawer

I created a basic template app with a [drawer](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/design/drawer) and  [bottom navigation bar](https://pub.dev/packages/persistent_bottom_nav_bar).

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
